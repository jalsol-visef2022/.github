# Detecting common diseases on coffee trees via images of leaves

Kon Tum is a province famous in Vietnam for its production of coffee, which plays an important part in helping the local people escape poverty.
However, every year, pests and diseases have always been a concern, causing a huge damage cost.

This project, with the help of Deep Learning, aims at applying image classification on coffee leaves, which has yet to be common objects for such technique.

This project won a Third Prize in the field of Embedded Systems at the 2022 Vietnamese National Science and Engineering Fair for Secondary students.
